AdventureWorks2022 is a Microsoft SQL Server sample database that models a company. It includes tables for sales, customers, products, and employees, making it ideal for learning database management and querying. Key operations involve retrieving customer sales data, analyzing orders, and performing complex joins. For example, finding total sales for a customer like ‘Gustavo Achong’ requires joining Person.Person, Sales.Customer, and Sales.SalesOrderHeader.
